# Bee-Populations-in-the-US
This project investigates trends in honey bee populations across various regions over the past 20 years. Using publicly available datasets, we explore factors contributing to population changes, including pesticides, climate change, and habitat loss.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

The goal of this analysis is to:

- Track changes in honey bee populations from 2002 to 2017
- Identify geographic regions with the most significant declines
- Correlate bee population trends with external stressors such as pesticide use, climate variability, and land use changes

---

## ðŸ§ª Methodology

- **Data Cleaning**: Standardized and merged different formats across sources.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identified trends, outliers, and key variables.
- **Statistical Modeling**: Used regression and correlation analysis to explore relationships between bee populations and potential stressors.
- **Visualization**: Created line plots, choropleth maps, and heatmaps using `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `plotly`.

# Key Contributing Factors

The decline of bee populations in the United States is a growing concern, as bees play a crucial role in pollination, impacting food production and biodiversity. Several factors contribute to the decline of these essential pollinators, which are outlined below.

---

## 1. **Pesticide Exposure**

### Overview:
Pesticides, particularly **neonicotinoids**, have been found to impair bees' ability to navigate, forage, and reproduce. Bees can come into contact with these chemicals through contaminated nectar, pollen, or direct exposure.

### Key Effects:
- Disorientation and impaired navigation.
- Weakened immune systems, increasing vulnerability to diseases.
- Colony death and population decline.

---

## 2. **Habitat Loss**

### Overview:
Urbanization, agricultural expansion, and habitat destruction have significantly reduced the availability of wildflowers and native plants, which bees need for foraging and nesting.

### Key Effects:
- Decreased food and shelter availability.
- Loss of nesting areas.
- Reduced biodiversity and ecosystem resilience.

---

## 3. **Climate Change**

### Overview:
Climate change alters the blooming periods of plants that bees rely on for nectar and pollen. Extreme weather events like floods and droughts can also destroy bee habitats.

### Key Effects:
- Mismatch between bees' lifecycle and plant blooming schedules.
- Habitat destruction due to extreme weather.
- Changes in the range of both plants and bee species.

---

## 4. **Monoculture Farming**

### Overview:
Monoculture farming, where only one type of crop is grown, offers limited food diversity for bees. While some crops provide abundant food for bees during certain times of the year, they do not offer a year-round food supply.

### Key Effects:
- Poor nutrition due to lack of diversity in forage.
- Inconsistent food sources that lead to nutritional stress.
- Reduced habitat complexity and overall biodiversity.

---

## 5. **Pathogens and Parasites**

### Overview:
Bees are susceptible to various pathogens and parasites, especially the **Varroa destructor mite**, which weakens bees by feeding on their bodily fluids and transmitting diseases.

### Key Effects:
- Colony weakening and high mortality rates.
- Increased vulnerability to other stressors.
- Lower reproductive rates and colony survival.

---

## 6. **Poor Bee Management Practices**

### Overview:
Commercial beekeeping practices such as colony transport, overharvesting, and the use of chemicals can stress bee populations. Moving hives across long distances, especially for monoculture pollination, exposes bees to new environmental stresses and diseases.

### Key Effects:
- Stress and disease transmission due to hive transport.
- Lower genetic diversity within colonies.
- Weakened immune systems due to overuse of chemicals.

---

## 7. **Invasive Species**

### Overview:
Invasive species like the **Asian hornet** pose a direct threat to bee populations by hunting honeybees and destroying hives. Additionally, invasive plants compete with native flora, further reducing food sources for bees.

### Key Effects:
- Direct predation and destruction of hives.
- Competition with native plants for pollination.
- Disruption of natural ecosystems.

---

## 8. **Nutritional Stress**

### Overview:
Bees experience nutritional stress when deprived of a diverse range of food sources. Lack of variety in pollen and nectar can lead to deficiencies in essential nutrients, weakening their immune system and increasing vulnerability to diseases.

### Key Effects:
- Reduced colony health and vitality.
- Lower reproductive success.
- Increased mortality rates.

---

## Conclusion:

The decline in bee populations in the U.S. is caused by multiple interconnected factors, including pesticide exposure, habitat loss, climate change, and poor management practices. Addressing these challenges requires a comprehensive approach involving better pesticide management, habitat restoration, sustainable farming practices, and improved beekeeping strategies.
